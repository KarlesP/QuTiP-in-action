# QuTiP in action
Here you can find a working example code of J. R. Johansson's "Single Atom Lasing using QuTiP" lectures.

**Why?**
Because learning though example is faster and I believe that coding Quantum Mechanics is better than solving an equation.

**How?**
It's easier to understand Hamiltonian transformations in action than when you're reading about them. So here you go, a working example.

### Installing

On Windows download [QuTiP](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#qutip)'s .whl file based on your version of Python (35=3.5, 24=2.4)
and then open CMD as an admin, run
```
cd C:\Users\path\to\AnacondaX\Scripts
```

And then run

```
pip install path\to\file\QuTiP.whl
```
for example if you have Anaconda3, downladed a file named "qutip-4.2.0-cp36-cp36m-win_32.whl", you have a 32bit system and python 3.6 you will have to open cmd as admin and run
```
cd C:\Users\user1\Anaconda4\Scripts>
pip install C:\Users\user1\Downloads\qutip-4.2.0-cp36-cp36m-win_32.whl

```
